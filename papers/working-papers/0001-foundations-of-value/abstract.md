## Abstract

Modern economics treats price as a proxy for value despite lacking a formal definition of value itself.

This work introduces a framework in which value is defined as a measurable informational cost required to produce or verify a state change. The framework separates value from market negotiation and instead grounds it in physical and computational constraints.

The paper establishes the conceptual basis for entropy-bound intrinsic value and motivates a transition from price-discovery systems to value-measurement systems.
