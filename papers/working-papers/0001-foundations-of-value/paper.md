# Foundations of Value

## 1. The Missing Definition

Economic systems operate on price yet lack a formal definition of value.
Price is observable.
Value is assumed.

This paper begins with the claim:

Economics measures exchange without measuring what is exchanged.

## 2. Value vs Price

Price is a negotiated ratio between agents.

Value is the minimum irreducible cost required to produce or verify a state change.

The two are related but not equivalent.

## 3. Informational Cost

Every transformation requires constraint resolution.

The cost of resolving constraint is measurable as informational effort.

Therefore value is not opinion — it is bounded by reality.

## 4. Toward Intrinsic Value

If value depends on irreducible cost,
then systems can measure value instead of discovering price.

This motivates entropy-bound intrinsic value.
